#Weekly Webdev Challange -  2
--------------------------------


This is my own solution to **Weekly Webdev Challange** (**challange 2**). More information you can find either on [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923/) or on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw2hu70L5Ye_VkhvdDZhN3haSlE). In near future I will try to do all tasks and publish my solutions for them. It'd be great to hear a comment about this code from you.

###Description


To prepare environment to develop this task I also used [frontend-starter](https://github.com/implico/frontend-starter) framework. In my opinion it is a great tool to build apps rapidly. This tool has a logical folder structure, gulp task runner to automate a job and it is fully customizable. With this tool I can only focus on “to-do” tasks. If you would like to try this tool yourself, please visit a link above and there you will find an instruction how to use it.

For review purpose all codes are compiled but not compressed and they are placed on **dist** folder.

Solution is published [**here**](https://wooqash.github.io/WWCH/Task2/dist/).

To prepare this solutions I used:

- HTML with Bootstrap 3 classes/elements,  
- sass version of Bootstrap 3 files compailed to css, 
- JQuery library,

I created this template as a RWD solution, mobile first approach and with accessibility elements like special HTML attributes. . Additionaly I added smooth scorlling feature and support to 'View more' buttons in gallery and blog sections. I also created a simple validation for all fields from forms at the page (contact, newsletter).
